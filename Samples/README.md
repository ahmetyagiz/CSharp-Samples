Variables

What is a variable?
Variables are our data holders that we use when developing applications.

It is important to choose the right data type depending on the type and size of the data we use. For example, if we only need to keep a single character, it will be sufficient to define your Char data type for that data. It is unnecessary to use a variable of type String. It is important to be able to decide on the right data types for the performance of the application.

Variable definition structure : (Variable Type) (Variable Name) = (Value)

Some points to consider when defining variables are as follows:

-Variables are case sensitive.
-Variable names cannot start with numbers.
-Variable names cannot contain spaces. Only "_" can be used.
-Mathematical expressions, that is, operation operators, cannot be used between variable names.
-Proper names such as class namespace cannot be used.
-Variables must always have a value. Otherwise null must be defined. The compiler throws an error when using unassigned variables.

For the place it occupies in memory: "Width / 8 = Memory Size"

Example: 8 (byte) / 8 = 1

It will occupy 1 byte of computer memory.

Operators

We use operators when we want to make an assignment or state comparison from within the application. Sometimes the block of code to run needs to change depending on the conditions. This can be achieved by using decision structures and operators together.

According to their functions, operators are categorized as follows.

Assignment and Operational Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)

Logical Operators (||, &&, !)

Relational Operators (==,!=, <, >, >=,<=)

Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %, ++, --)
